"""Regression tests for path-target handling in the ``check`` command.

Issue #17: ``lanorme check <file.py>`` silently reported zero findings while
``lanorme check <dir>`` on the same tree fired, because ``os.walk`` over a file
yields nothing. These lock the fix: a file target is walked via its surrounding
directory and the findings are narrowed back to the requested path(s), so a file
target reports exactly what the directory run reports for that file.
