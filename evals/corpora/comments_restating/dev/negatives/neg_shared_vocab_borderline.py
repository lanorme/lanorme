"""Borderline negatives: very short comments whose few words all overlap code.

These are the corpus's stress test for precision. Every non-stopword in the
comment substring-matches an identifier on the next line, yet the comment still
adds a unit, a constraint, or a caveat. A pure word-overlap detector is liable
to flag these; a good detector must not.
