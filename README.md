# LaNorme

A linter for Python. It checks the usual things, dead code, file and function
size, complexity, weak types, hardcoded secrets, dangerous calls, and a few
things most linters do not: hexagonal layer boundaries, ports-and-adapters
wiring, and a project's own naming vocabulary.

Standard library only. No runtime dependencies. Python 3.13+.

```console
$ lanorme check .
```

## Install

```console
uv tool install lanorme
```

Or run it once without installing:

```console
uvx lanorme check .
```

It also installs with `pip` / `pipx` the usual way.

## Usage

```console
lanorme check [PATHS...]            # run every enabled check (default path: .)
lanorme check . --check=secrets     # run one check by name
lanorme check . --select TYPE,AUTHN # only these rule codes or categories
lanorme check . --ignore NAMING-003 # skip specific rules
lanorme check . --output-format json
lanorme rules                       # list every registered rule
lanorme rule  SQL-001               # show the reference for one rule
```

Exit code is `1` when any check fails, `0` when the tree is clean.

A run looks like this:

```console
$ lanorme check src/
[FAIL] secrets
  VIOLATION: app.py:8 — Hardcoded credential value bound to 'API_KEY'
    Rule: SECRETPY-001: No hardcoded secrets in source code
    Fix: Read the value from an environment variable, secrets manager, or settings module
```

### Suppressing a finding

A `# noqa` at the end of a line silences every rule on that line; `# noqa: CODE`
silences only the listed codes (a full code like `SQL-001` or a category like
`SQL`):

```python
def legacy_handler(req):  # noqa: KWARG-001
    return req.text  # noqa
```

For whole directories, use the per-file table in your config (below).

## Configuration

LaNorme walks up from the target path looking for config: a dedicated
`lanorme.toml`, otherwise a `[tool.lanorme]` table in `pyproject.toml`. Command
line flags win over both.

```toml
[tool.lanorme]
select = ["ALL"]                            # rule codes or categories to run
ignore = ["NAMING-003"]                     # rule codes or categories to skip
exclude = ["build/*", "vendor/*"]           # path globs to skip entirely
plugins = ["myproject.checks.house_rules"]  # extra check modules to load

# Silence specific rules for matching paths (the file is still scanned).
[tool.lanorme.per-file-ignores]
"tests/**/*.py"   = ["AAA", "SECRETPY"]
"alembic/**/*.py" = ["SQL"]
"notebooks/*.py"  = ["KWARG", "DRY"]

# Each per-check table is handed to that check.
[tool.lanorme.stray_artifacts]
extensions = [".zip", ".pdf"]               # also flag these (JUNK-002)
allow = ["docs/diagram.png"]                # never flag these (globs)

[tool.lanorme.forbidden_paths]
dirs = ["legacy_src", "build_artifacts"]    # these directories must not exist

[[tool.lanorme.domain_terms.rules]]
id = "TERM-001"
canonical = "Account"
forbidden = ["Acct", "Acnt"]
```

## What it checks

`lanorme rules` prints the live list. Each rule, what it catches and does not,
its config, and where measured its precision and recall on the bundled test
corpora, is in [`docs/RULES.md`](docs/RULES.md).

On by default, on any project, no config needed:

| Rule | Catches |
|---|---|
| `CMT-001/002` | commented-out code, over-long comment blocks |
| `DRY-001` | near-duplicate function bodies |
| `SIZE-001..003` / `COMPLEXITY-001` / `PARAM-001` | file, function and class size; cyclomatic complexity; parameter count |
| `IMPORT-001` / `ENDPOINT-001` | imports inside function bodies; deeply nested endpoints |
| `NAMING-003/004` | HTTP-verb-to-handler match; boolean-prefix predicates |
| `TYPE-001..003` | `dict[str, Any]`, bare containers, untyped `**kwargs` |
| `AUTHN-001` / `SQL-001` / `SECRETPY-001` | mutation endpoints without an auth dependency; raw SQL at a database call; hardcoded secrets in `.py` |
| `SHELL-001` / `DESERIAL-001` / `EVAL-001` / `CRYPTO-001` / `TLS-001` / `DEBUG-001` | shell injection, unsafe deserialisation, `eval`/`exec`, weak hashes, disabled TLS, debug mode |
| `JUNK-001/002` | screenshots, scratch files, OS junk, stray binaries |
| `TESTFILE-001` | a production module with no `test_*.py` partner |
| `META-001..005` | the checks themselves emit well-formed output |

Off until you turn them on:

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| `LAYER-001..005` | needs a layered layout (`domain/ application/ infrastructure/ api/`) |
| `PORT-001..003` | needs an `application/ports/` directory |
| `TERM-NNN` | needs a vocabulary in `[tool.lanorme.domain_terms]` |
| `PATH-001` / `STALE-001` | need forbidden dirs / stale tokens configured |
| `KWARG-001` | keyword-only call sites; a strong house style |
| `NAMING-001/002` | CRUD method prefixes; conflicts with domain naming |
| `AAA-001/002` | Arrange-Act-Assert markers and DRY in tests |
| `CMT-005` | restating-comment detector; experimental, precision-first |
| `PROSE-001..003` | em dashes, US spelling and emoji in Markdown or comments |

## Writing a check

A check is any object with `name`, `description`, `rules`, and a `run` method:

```python
from lanorme import CheckResult, Status, Violation, register


class MyCheck:
    name = "my_check"
    description = "What it enforces"
    rules = ["MYCODE-001: the rule, in one line"]

    def run(self, *, src_root: str) -> CheckResult:
        violations: list[Violation] = []
        # inspect files under src_root
        status = Status.FAIL if violations else Status.PASS
        return CheckResult(check=self.name, status=status, violations=violations)


register(MyCheck())
```

Drop it in `lanorme/checks/`, ship it under the `lanorme.checks` entry-point
group, or point at it with `[tool.lanorme] plugins = [...]`. LaNorme finds it
and runs it.

## Versioning

The public surface is the rule codes you put in `select` / `ignore` /
`per-file-ignores` and the config keys under `[tool.lanorme]`. Renaming a rule,
dropping one, or turning a default-on rule off is a breaking change; adding a
rule or a new config key with a sensible default is not. Before 1.0, breaking
changes land in minor releases and are listed in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
